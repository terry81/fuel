# Fuel theft finder

This has been tested with MySQL. Should be similar for other databases, you just need a different connector.

Install the needed pip modules:

```
pip install mysql-connector-python pandas
```

Use populate_fuel.py to create an example db with sample fuel data.
Use detect_theft.py to detect discrepancies.
